Doing this project I learned how to use the react library. A couple of new concepts such as one way data flow, components, containers. I liked how we implemented the search, that was new to me. In a ztm course Andrei Neagonie (coach) was using CRA (create react app) tool to simplify the proccess of development and focus more on logic. Nonetheless, I have found out at the end of the development that the CRA tool shows a dozen of vulnerabilities (after running a command npm audit), so I asked for an advice in a ztm community. Big thanks to a star mentor Ace Mouty and an alumni David for helping me out. Now I know that CRA is no longer the prescribed way to build react apps. Today react apps are built using Vite or NextJS or some other React framework.


# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
